go-notify

C Dependencies: libnotify
GO Dependencies: github.com/mattn/go-gtk/glib

This package provides GO bindings for the C library libnotify.
Although this package provides full retro-compatibility with the regular C
library, it also provides OOP-like functions for the NotifyNotification object.

The notify package depends on mattn's glib wrapper for the GO language.
